The homepage is index.html. Go to localhost/index.html to access the website. The webpages are elections.php, regression.php, maps.php, information.php and pages constructed based on input: countydata.php?county=Example County and statedata.php?state=EX
Python files support the functioning of the website: generate_county_page.py, generate_state_page.py, plot_counties.py, linreg2.py, correlationmap.py
The files have comments which explain how to update the files if the database name is changed or data fields are added.
The website uses php5, HMTL5, CSS, Python3, Python2, and SQLite3. This allowed us to customize the website to a great extent and format the output in an accessible way. 
To prevent command injection, the website uses checkboxes and dropdowns. The exception is the county and state data pages, you could type in a command, so it is sent to the python file as a string and the python file processes it.
